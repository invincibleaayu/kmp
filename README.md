# Knuth-Morris-Pratt substring search
Python implementation of Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithim
<h2>The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm</h2>
<p>The Knuth-Morris-Pratt String Searching Algorithm or KMP Algorithm searches for occurrences of a "Pattern" within a main "Text" by employing the observation that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient information to determine where the next match could begin, thus bypassing re-examination of previously matched characters. The algorithm was conceived in 1970 by Donuld Knuth and Vaughan Pratt and independently by James H. Morris. The trio published it jointly in 1977.</p>
